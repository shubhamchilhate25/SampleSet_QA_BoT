# **QA Bot - Document-Based Question Answering**

This project is a document-based **QA bot** built using **OpenAI's GPT models**, **FAISS** for vector-based search, and **Streamlit** for the frontend interface. The bot allows users to upload PDF documents, ask questions about the content of those documents, and get real-time answers.

## **Features**
- Upload up to **5 PDF documents** at once.
- Ask **natural language questions** about the content of uploaded documents.
- Get real-time, context-aware answers using **OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo** model.
- Document embeddings are stored in **FAISS** for efficient similarity-based retrieval.

## **Setup Instructions (Without Docker)**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SampleSet_QA_BoT.git
cd SampleSet_QA_BoT
```

### **2. Create a Virtual Environment**
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On **Mac/Linux**:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
Once the virtual environment is active, install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Set Up API Keys**
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your **OpenAI API key**:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### **5. Run the Application**
After installing the dependencies and setting up the `.env` file, run the app using Streamlit:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your browser to access the app.

## **Setup Instructions (With Docker)**

### **1. Install Docker**
If you don’t have Docker installed, follow the installation instructions for your platform:
- [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### **2. Build the Docker Image**
Run the following command in the project root to build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t qa-bot .
```

### **3. Run the Docker Container**
Once the image is built, run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 qa-bot
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your browser to interact with the app.

## **Usage**

### **Uploading Documents**
- You can upload **up to 5 PDF documents** at a time using the file uploader on the left sidebar of the app.
  
### **Asking Questions**
- Once the documents are uploaded, type your question in the input field labeled **“Ask a question”**.
  
### **Viewing Responses**
- The bot will process the question, retrieve relevant document sections, and display the answer on the main page.
  
### **Example Usage**
1. **Upload Documents**: 
   - Click on the "Browse files" button to upload PDFs.
   
2. **Ask a Question**: 
   - Type a question like: _"What are the key findings of the report?"_

3. **View the Response**:
   - The bot will generate an answer based on the uploaded documents.

## **Known Issues**

1. **Rate Limits**: OpenAI's API has rate limits and quotas. If you encounter errors related to quota limits, ensure that your OpenAI account has sufficient usage limits.
   
2. **Large Documents**: Extremely large documents may take time to process, and you may experience delays depending on your system resources.
   
3. **Docker Setup**: On Windows, Docker might require **WSL 2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Ensure that WSL 2 is properly installed and configured.
